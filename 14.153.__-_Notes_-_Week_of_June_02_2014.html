<h3>Stickleback Grant Meeting 11:15a</h3>

<p>Cliff showed some graphs of his experiments.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>we need to define, ahead of time, what speciation means</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>pre-zygotic (do they want to mate with each other)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>post-zygotic (are their matings successful)</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>sterility</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>hybrid low fitness, and hybrids having trouble getting mates</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>prevalence of hybrids</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
				<p>&lt; 1/n^e (which makes hybrid impact less than that of drift)</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Interspersed development (during above meeting)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>looking at where my builds are located.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>AvidaDebuggerOnly is under ~/Dropbox/School Docs/Research/AvidaDev/AvidaDebuggerOnly</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research thoughts (11:50a)</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>think about whether the display A/B increased by performance of tasks</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>limited resources (niching) gets you divergence of display A/B and prefer A/B</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>non-limited does not.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Does this sufficiently allow for speciation based on drift?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Do we want niching? The speciation between benthic and limnetic stickleback was not sympatric, but geographic.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>So, no niching. Just geographic separation. Maybe use limited resources, because all environments contain limited resources</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>My gut is that tasks hitting only two display traits is not enough</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>Why? Why do I feel that?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>First of all, because half of the time, they may randomly land on the same task, where if there are more options, the chance of randomly landing on the same task is lower.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>So, you also want them to evolve separately long enough under different conditions such that they DO NOT want to blend their species when they are rejoined.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Also, concerned about the populations having to compete with each other when they rejoin. So, do we want niching to prevent the populations from just wiping one another out?</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Lab Meeting (3pm)</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>writing code to do separation of populations.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>do tagging of organisms when the &ldquo;wall&rdquo; drops, and then have the birth chamber check for the tag during the period of separation.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>writing code to add fuzzy matching to nop-based sexual selection</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Do they choose fuzzy vs hard match? Check with an easy experiment</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>write a version of fuzzy match that lets you adjust the rate of fuzziness.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Log 10:56PM</h3>

<p>Ok, but really, what the hell am I supposed to be doing?</p>

<p>Ok, I&#39;m going to try to do the thing with adding the wall to the code. Um. I may move downstairs for this.</p>
