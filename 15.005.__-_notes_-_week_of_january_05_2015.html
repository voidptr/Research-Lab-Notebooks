<h4 class="item_body_heading_2"><u>Regarding Writing Prompts</u></h4>

<p>Nothing worthwhile is magically created fully formed. There are a few different ways to do writing, each method being suited to a different type of writing. Creative writing *could* be done stream of consciousness, but most writers benefit from having scaffolds of ideas and outlines for plot and character arc. These items are useful because if you want to write a work of sufficient complexity and depth, and not miss any of the important points that you are trying to make. You need to keep those ideas swapped into the current context as you are writing.</p>

<p>So, why the fuck should scientific writing expect to be exempt when even bullshit creative writing can&#39;t get away with it. So, why the hell should I be trying to conjure a research paper out of thin air without creating a framework around it? And, how the hell am I expected to conjure the FRAMEWORK out of thin air as well? The mold for the paper that I hope to fill with lead and fire has to be shaped out of something. I have to have an idea of what to look for.</p>

<p>So, here is my outline for my outline. Here&#39;s a set of questions that I want to set out to answer in my paper. Answering these questions will be the shape and content of my outline. If I don&#39;t know what the answer is, maybe I should examine if I understand the question. How can I have an answer if I don&#39;t know what the question is? So, a series of questions, going ever further back, until I hit the principle of what my paper is for.</p>

<h4 class="item_body_heading_2"><u>The First Question</u>(s)</h4>

<p>What are my sections? (provisionally)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Introduction</li>
	<li>Evolution of Modularity and Evolvability in Changing Environments</li>
	<li>Reproductive Isolation Via Sexual Selection</li>
	<li>Proposal - Evolvability and Sexual Selection</li>
	<li>Proposal - Horizontal Gene Transfer, Modularity and Evolvability</li>
</ul>

<p>What should each of my sections contain?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Background (larger if proposal)</li>
	<li>Methods</li>
	<li>(if completed) Results and Discussion</li>
	<li>(if completed) Conclusion</li>
</ul>

<p>What am I trying to accomplish in each section?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Introduction
	<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Background
	<ul>
		<li>What do I want to see in a Background?
		<ul>
			<li>Context. Relevance. A Tutorial in the Field and How I Fit In It.
			<ul>
				<li>Context about what the field or subfield is primarily interested in understanding. What kinds of questions are being asked that are relevant to my work? (not pointing out the relevance, but using it to filter out what&#39;s important to ME) What are the big questions in the field? What field is it?</li>
				<li>Brief discussions about what kinds of things we know in the field, and where there are controversies. Specifically, what knowledge or controversy is relevant to my work? (not pointing out the relevance, but using it to filter out what&#39;s important to ME)</li>
				<li>What question am I asking. How does it relate to known or controversial things? How my work fits into that context.</li>
				<li>Have other people asked similar questions? What have they found?</li>
				<li>How does my question in particular propose to expand the knowledge in my field. What is the novelty?
				<ul>
					<li>Does it answer a novel question?</li>
					<li>Does it look at an existing problem in a new way?</li>
					<li>Does is confirm an existing result in a new organism or by a new method</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Methods
	<ul>
		<li>What do I want to see in Methods?
		<ul>
			<li>What question are you proposing to answer/did you answer?
			<ul>
				<li><em>Tell the story of the problem, even if it wasn&#39;t the story you started out with. You don&#39;t get points for getting directly from A to B, but you need to tell the story straightforwardly and coherently, AS IF you were going from A to B. To do otherwise, and follow along with every meandering turn, would not be easy to read or understand. You want your reader to take away the knowledge you found. The completeness of the timeline is not important. What are the highlights?</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>How do you propose to answer the question?
			<ul>
				<li>What system will you use to ask it?</li>
				<li>What experiment will you run?</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>How will you know if you&#39;ve answered it?
			<ul>
				<li>What is the null hypothesis?</li>
				<li>What controls?</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Results and Discussion
	<ul>
		<li>What did I find? Reiterate the question. Show the results. Was my hypothesis rejected? Confirmed?
		<ul>
			<li><em>Remember that it&#39;s possible that the answer you got may not be to the question you asked in the first place. That&#39;s alright. Just keep updating your hypothesis as you follow the research along until your question and answer match up. Every experiment you run has a hypothesis to go along with it, even if it is initially vague or cryptic to you. Even if you are just following a hunch. If the hunch hits pay dirt, and you haven&#39;t already done so, dig into the hunch until you can express it coherently as a hypothesis.</em></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Conclusion
	<ul>
		<li>What conclusion can we draw from these experiments? What do my results suggest for the larger picture of research in this field?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="item_body_heading_2"><u>Other Thoughts on Writing</u></h4>

<p>So, it occurred to me that one of the things that was preventing me from writing every day was the barrier of not knowing what to write. The having of writers *block* (though this may be a simplistic understanding of the word as it applies to others, but fuck, this is about what writing block means to ME, since I&#39;m writing it. It&#39;s what writing block is from my limited perspective. We can deal with issues of relativism of language and universality some other time, fuck you.)</p>

<p>But, not knowing what to write doesn&#39;t rob you of the ability to form complete sentences, right? It&#39;s just that you can&#39;t think of what to write about. Well, fine, here&#39;s an idea. If you can&#39;t think of what to write about, write about not knowing what to write about. Ramble on about why you may feel stopped up. Do you have a headache that day? Do you feel hungry? Do you not feel inspired? What are you feelings in general? Surely the block is making you feel anxious, right? Write about that. My thought is that it might help fill up the time, since you&#39;ll be writing words no matter what (this is the committment) to write them around the block. To write them around and about the feeling of being blocked. If you&#39;re going to sit there staring at the screen, your fingers might as well be moving. And then, the content of the blocked writing can be turned into a post to your blog about writers block. Essentially, if you&#39;re feeling stuck, do some writing self-therapy.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, what if you&#39;ve filled days and days and pages and pages of meandering rumination about writers block and you&#39;re no closer to arriving at the root of WHY you are feeling blocked, much less a fix. Ok, that&#39;s when we do writing exercises.</p>

<p>Do some auto-writing. Just write what you are experiencing, minute to minute. Get your hands moving and your observational muscles pulling.</p>

<p>Roll some dice to create a pair of characters. Roll some dice to give them background situations. Roll some dice to give them motivations. (you know about random character generation, right?) Finally, roll some dice about why they are trapped in an elevator/bank vault/speeding bus. Have them talk about their mothers. Get it?</p>

<p>Do hypothetical outlining. Don&#39;t commit to making a story. Fuck, don&#39;t commit to finishing anything ever. As soon as you have commitment, you have anxiety, which is the killer of inspiration. Anyway, yes, hypothetical outlining. Come up with the stupidest plot you can think of, add characters, add scenes that move the plot forward. Pretty soon you have a stew going!</p>
