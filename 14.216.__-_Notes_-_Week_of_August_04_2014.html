<p>I&#39;m in Barstow, CA. I ran some runs overnight, testing my pipeline. It looks like the organisms aren&#39;t using the codes the way that I wanted or expected. They are tending toward 15s and 14s, regardless of the task tree. Um, I think I need to know if they&#39;re bothering to do the other tasks or not. Right now the config just doesn&#39;t provide either the task or the resource. I need to provide both, but make the resource never appear. This is purely so that I can track the values of the tasks.</p>

<ul>
	<li>change the resource setup so that I can see what the phenotypic mix is between them.</li>
	<li>histogram of display C codes by phenotype</li>
	<li>change the display C code use such that it has to be set as something other than 0. This might mean the females also need to do set display trait C, as opposed to just sucking it in... But this is a problem because that would mean hooking it into matching phenotypes, which is bad.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Log 3:30p (PST)</h3>

<p>Ah, shit. So, I lost my entire log from Friday. There was a meeting in there for the stickleback folk, and they had shared some insights. Lemme see if I can remember what they were.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cliff says 70/30 is high for the display trait vs random.</li>
	<li>It might be helpful to further simplify the display sets. Like, bring it down to only four options.</li>
	<li>Jenny says she&#39;s not surprised that they didn&#39;t diverge upon doing different task sets.</li>
	<li>That doing exact matches might make them use the values more stringently, since doing approximate matches may not be appreciably different from choosing random. So, I&#39;m going to try that first, and see if they use it more, as opposed to random.</li>
</ul>
