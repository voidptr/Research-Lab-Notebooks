<p>Ok, but seriously, I did do work this week. I chatted with Charles over the phone on the way to Annie&#39;s house. We talked about the issues with the birth chamber and one half of the population getting excluded from being able to mate. Charles asserts it&#39;s a scheduler issue. I am extremely skeptical. I divided the birth chamber into halves by zone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&#39;t fix the problem. They now have appropriately full birth chambers, but the one half is running so much more slowly than the other that they just don&#39;t often get to execute their genomes. So, they end up evolving super slowly. I tried changing the task reward multiplier to additive instead of pow. It helped, but not enough that I feel confident that the zones are going to evolve at comparable rates.</p>

<h3>Plan</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Run 1 - Full population, 100k, limited resources whole stack of tasks, no rewards for tasks.</li>
	<li>Run 2a &amp; b - 100k (or fixed # of generations), divide outcome population of run 1 into two runs of 30x60. Each zone has a different half of the resource tree.</li>
	<li>Run 3 - combine outcomes of runs 2a and 2b into combined population. See if they mate with each other.
	<ul>
		<li>Concerns:
		<ul>
			<li>They won&#39;t have an opportunity to mate with each other because one half will wipe out the other (in the combined birth chamber) before they even get to choose mates
			<ul>
				<li>Might be able to alleviate this by dumping them into separate zones, but don&#39;t mate discriminate, so have a separated birth chamber offspring stack that they can then look at.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Measure:
	<ul>
		<li>Population Diversity
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed length organisms</li>
			<li>Entropy at each site.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Sexual choosyness
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure this shit is working</li>
			<li>&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Controls:
	<ul>
		<li>Sexual population - unlimited resources</li>
		<li>Sexual population - limited resources</li>
	</ul>

<p>Ok, I did some things. I submitted some runs (108) using limited resources, no wall, and 50k updates for the organisms to adjust and do whatever the hell they&#39;re going to do.</p>
