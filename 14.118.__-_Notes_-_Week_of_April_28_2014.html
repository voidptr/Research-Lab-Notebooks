<h3>Skype chat with Charles.</h3>

<p>Discussed my thoughts on section 4 (evolvability and sexual selection)</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>forget the lek stuff. too unrelated</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>basic control:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>evolve with sex, change the environment once (from one tree+equals, to the other side of the tree+eq) (each level has two, so pick one task from each level, making two branches that you switch between). Do control, plus no-reward, plus punish.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>experiments:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>add direct condition-dependent sexual selection (directly based on merit).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>add abstracted condition-dependent sexual selection (task which increases merit display)</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Will do experiments today/this week, and then talk about it.</p>

<h3>Lab Meeting</h3>

<p>Talked about my experiments, and Josh will send me a paper on changing environmental adaptation rates. So, talked about the abstracted condition-dependent traits, and how you actually encode that in a trait. So, loci to express the trait.</p>
