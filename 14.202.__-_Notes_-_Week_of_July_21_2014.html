<p>So, I rolled back to an earlier commit without the separated birth chamber queues. It stabilizes at 147mb, so there is definitely a memory leak going on with my code. :/ For now, though, for the initial data gathering part, I don&#39;t need it to have a separate birth chamber. So, that&#39;s running in the earlier commit. I branched it.</p>

<p>I submitted some runs to the HPCC using the non-leaky code</p>

<p>Submitted a series of test runs, and have finally settled on a set of conditions. Run 111.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Non-leaky</li>
	<li>Shorter display trait C value (4 bits)</li>
	<li>100k length to give them time to evolve using it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chatted with Charles and gave update. Explained how altering the scheduler wouldn&#39;t be a good idea. He agrees.</p>

<p>Compiling boost to use with EALib. Annoying. Had to do this: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/42282#comment:9</p>

<p>Ok, I&#39;m sure I did some shit between Monday night and now, with getting the runs actually working and running, but I didn&#39;t write anything down because I&#39;m an idiot. Also, I flew in to Vegas on Tuesday, and haven&#39;t done anything since. So, I need to review my notes. Um, I also may want to modify Noodle to be able to piece together important data from previous log entries and then show them to me. Like, adding custom XML tags that are shown as emphasis or something, which can then be unchecked when those thoughts are done. Like describing overarching notes to display. So, like some kind of control view, separate from the vanilla journal view. So, a new window that isn&#39;t just the notes window (maybe with a parameter?). Maybe show them up above the [Home] link, and have them be presented as links that I can follow to their sources? Maybe it&#39;s not XML tags. Maybe it&#39;s brackets? []? [[]]? Something like that? Maybe if you mouse over them, it shows you a tool-tip with the rest of the surrounding text? Maybe each entry file should include some meta-data in the header? How can I do this while falling back to a simple HTML document in absence of Noodle?</p>

<p>Ok, I&#39;ve digressed enough. And it&#39;s 50 minutes later. :/</p>

<p>Ok, fuck all that. I found a plugin for Firefox that tiles windows. I can just put up a tile at the top that shows a separate document of my choice. No need to add any new or weird functionality to Noodle.</p>

<p>Back to work. I&#39;ve made a document called <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/00.000._-_Big_Picture">Big Picture</a> that contains whatever thing it is that I&#39;m trying to do.</p>
