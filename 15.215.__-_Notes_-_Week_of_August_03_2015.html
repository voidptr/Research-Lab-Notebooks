However, it is unclear to what degree each of these factors influences the formation of new species, or at what time-scales.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:14.6666666666667px">We evolved populations of sexually reproducing and sexually selected digital organisms, whose females choose mates on the basis of a single trait, and both this trait and the choice is allowed to evolve. We then divided these populations into pairs, and evolved them under both similar and different environmental conditions. We, then rejoined them and measured the rate of F1 hybridization, as well as the viability and fitness of hybrid offspring. </span></span></p>

We also found that F1 hybrids did not have significantly lower fitnesses or rates of viability as compared to controls. We conclude that drift in traits related to sexual selection very quickly results in pre-zygotic incompatibility between separated sexually selecting populations, while post-zygotic factors, such as genetic architecture, do not vary enough to produce hybrid unfitness or inviability, at least at short timescales. We find that incompatibility of sexually selected traits significantly reduces gene flow between populations, even when geographic barriers are removed.</span><span style="background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:14.6666666666667px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>
