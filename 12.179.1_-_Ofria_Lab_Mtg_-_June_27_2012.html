<ul>
	<li>awesome evolvability graph &ndash; timeseries, Y- proportion of point mutations that change the phenotype, X &ndash; over time. Each line &ndash; Line of descent.</li>
	<li>Do some game theory simulations</li>
</ul>

<p>Mtg w/ Charles</p>

<ul>
	<li>talk about &ldquo;evolutionary potential&rdquo; rather than longer term evolvability</li>
	<li>write it up from a single-step evolutionary potential, rather than long-term evolutionary potential.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Genetic architecture</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Short term vs long term. You can select for short term, but,</li>
	<li>How can you ever select for long term evolutionary potential?</li>
	<li>Genetic architecture
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Robustness - promoting</li>
		<li>Epistasis</li>
		<li>Short term fitness trajectories</li>
		<li>Fitness landscapes</li>
		<li>Metrics, how does modularity and epistasis</li>
		<li>Population level vs. individual</li>
	</ul>

	<li>Population stuff
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Diversity of different types

			<li>Noisy diversity</li>
			<li>Structured diversity &ndash; make highways of diversity</li>

	<li>Evolutionary potential is final fitness</li>
	<li>Diversity and evolvability &ndash; what does it take?</li>
	<li>Expressed interest in Evolutionary Constraint

	<li>Modularity</li>
	<li>Genomic diffusion rate

		<li>Look at the probability of an organism producing offspring genotypic different, with not lower fitness
		<ul>
			<li>Acquisition of neutral mutations</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>This rate May give you insight on medium term fitness increase rates (so measure differential of fitness from point a and point b (fitness ratio) and gdr to predict correlation) More GDR, higher fitness ratio</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Measure GDR, or what ratio</li>
	<li>Talk to Dave about the runs for the ones that took 800k updates to get equals, WHAT CHANGED? Was it ratio, or GDR,&nbsp; or what, so this speaks to getting stuck and unstuck, and on to questions of genetic constraints.</li>
