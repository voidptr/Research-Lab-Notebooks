<blockquote>
<p>Persistent female choice for particular male trait values should erode genetic variance in male traits and thereby remove the benefits of choice, yet choice persists.[22] The enigma of how additive genetic variation is maintained in the face of consistent female preference is named the &ldquo;lek paradox.&rdquo; This paradox can be somewhat alleviated by the occurrence of mutations introducing potential differences, as well as the possibility that traits of interest have more or less favorable recessive alleles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The basis of the lek paradox is continuous genetic variation in spite of strong female preference for certain traits. There are two conditions in which the lek paradox arises, the first is that males contribute only genes and the second is that female preference does not affect fecundity.[23] Female selection should lead to directional selection, which would result in a greater prevalence for that trait. Stronger selection should lead to impaired survival because there will be a decrease in genetic variance since more offspring will have similar traits, which is also known as &ldquo;runaway selection&rdquo;.[24] Lekking species do not exhibit runaway selection.</p>

	<p>Another resolution to the lek paradox is &ldquo;Genic capture&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genic_capture">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genic_capture</a></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Genic capture</strong> is a hypothesis explaining the maintenance of genetic variance in traits under sexual selection. A classic problem in sexual selection is the fixation of alleles that are beneficial under strong selection, thereby eliminating the benefits of mate choice. Genic capture resolves this paradox by suggesting that additive genetic variance of sexually selected traits reflects the genetic variance in total condition.[1] A deleterious mutation anywhere in the genome will adversely affect condition, and thereby adversely affect a condition-dependent sexually selected trait. Genic capture therefore resolves the lek paradox by proposing that recurrent deleterious mutation maintains additive genetic variance in fitness by incorporating the entire mutation load of an individual. Thus any condition-dependent trait &quot;captures&quot; the overall genetic variance in condition. Rowe and Houle argued that genic capture ensures that good genes will become a central feature of the evolution of any sexually selected trait.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>genic capture depends on deleterious mutations negatively affecting a condition-dependent sexually selected trait.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Thoughts:</h4>

<p>So, a lot of Jay and Cliff&rsquo;s work is on non-condition-dependent sexual selection. The traits they use are not handicap traits, nor are they condition-dependent. So, in that case, you would expect to see no genic capture, and no resolution to the lex paradox. There *is* no paradox.</p>

<p>Maybe ask them to look at population diversity.</p>

<h4>Notes to self:</h4>

<p>Look up how to measure &ldquo;evolvability&rdquo; in the population genetics sense.</p>

<h4>Reading notes:</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Arbuthnott, Devin, and Howard D. Rundle. &quot;Sexual selection is ineffectual or inhibits the purging of deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster.&quot; <em>Evolution</em> 66.7 (2012): 2127-2137.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, the title is suggestive, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Essentially, the paper is testing (sort of) the concept of Genic capture. And they find evidence against it! :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clark, Sean CA, et al. &quot;Relative effectiveness of mating success and sperm competition at eliminating deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster.&quot; <em>PloS one</em> 7.5 (2012): e37351.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so these guys were testing the impacts of both pre- (intrasexual competition) or post-compulatory competition (sperm competition) on the clearing of deleterious alleles. They found some interesting stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While none of the tested mutations affected P2, there was a clear effect of condition. Conversely, several of the mutations affected mating success, while condition showed no effect. Our results suggest that precopulatory selection may be more effective than postcopulatory selection at removing deleterious mutations. The opposite result obtained for our diet manipulation points to an interesting discrepancy between environmental and genetic manipulations of condition, which may be explained by the multidimensionality of condition.</p>
