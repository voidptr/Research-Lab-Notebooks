<h4>Exploring reinforcing selection - hybrid unfitness</h4>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>females choose non-heterospecifics because of lower hybrid fitness</li>
	<li>comparing sympatric vs allopatric
	<ul>
		<li>you expect more sexual distinction in sympatric vs allopatric populations.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Limnetic-like and allopatric-like species that are allopatric.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Avida experiments</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Evolve formerly separate populations together for a while, and then see if they enforce choosyness more strongly after that rather than less.</li>
	<li>you have to enforce a lot lower fitness of hybrids.
	<ul>
		<li>Intrinsic hybrid unfitness
		<ul>
			<li>hybrid environmental unfitness
			<ul>
				<li>not so much evidence of this having a huge impact in plants, whose chromosomes evolve in length.</li>
				<li>intrinsic unfitness of hybrid genomes
				<ul>
					<li>reduced fecundity</li>
					<li>reduced viability</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>hybrid mating unfitness (you produce a trait that nobody looks at)</li>
		<li>extrinsic hybrid environmental unfitness
		<ul>
			<li>You just don&#39;t do so well in the environment, even though your genomes work.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Look at both components of hybrid unfitness , compare contribution of intrinsic vs extrinsic factors</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparing for new proposal - DUE JAN 28!!!!!</h4>

<ul>
	<li>a paragraph - description of the experiment for the reinforcing selection experiments.
	<ul>
		<li>look at the previous proposal section for the avida stuff.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>a figure - the pre-zygotic sympatric and allopatric (drift, treatment)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Meet on Jan 5, 11am</h4>
