<h3><strong>Readings for sexual selection and evolvability</strong></h3>

<h4>Paper 3</h4>

<p>Suggestive title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Loss of the deleterious Adh&ndash; allele was more rapid when sexual selection was allowed to act, especially in the presence of ethanol. We also quantified the strength of both nonsexual and sexual selection against the Adh&ndash; allele using maximum-likelihood estimation. In contrast to recent experiments employing monogamy/polygamy designs, our results demonstrate a fitness benefit to sexual selection. This is consistent with the operation of good-genes female choice.</p>

<h4>Description of &ldquo;genic capture&rdquo;</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>An extension of good genes models is the idea of genic capture, which pro- poses that sexually selected traits under strong directional selec- tion should eventually reach a point beyond which further devel- opment requires involving genetic variation that governs both the acquisition and allocation of resources (Rowe and Houle 1996).</p>

<p>This&hellip; isn&rsquo;t what I got out of the wikipedia article. I think I need to read the Rowe and Houle paper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rowe, Locke, and David Houle. &quot;The lek paradox and the capture of genetic variance by condition dependent traits.&quot; <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences</em> 263.1375 (1996): 1415-1421.</p>

<p><em>Abstract</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that sexually selected traits have unexpectedly high genetic variance. In this paper, we offer a simple and general mechanism to explain this observation. Our explanation offers a resolution to the lek paradox and rests on only two assumptions; <strong>condition dependence of sexually selected traits </strong>and <strong>high genetic variance in condition</strong>. The former assumption is well supported by empirical evidence. We discuss the evidence for the latter assumption. <strong>These two assumptions lead inevitably to the capture of genetic variance into sexually selected traits concomitantly with the evolution of condition dependence.</strong> We present a simple genetic model to illustrate this view. We then explore some implications of genic capture for the coevolution of female preference and male traits. Our exposition of this problem incidentally leads to new insights into the similarities between sexually selected traits and life history traits, and therefore into the maintenance of high genetic variance in the latter. Finally, we discuss some shortcomings of a recently proposed alternative solution to the lek paradox; selection on variance.</p>

<h3><strong>Separately, wrt the summer research project</strong></h3>

<p>The purpose of the project is to study gene expression wrt to differentiating between heterospecifics and conspecifics (mate species discrimination). In stickleback, they want to test what kinds of genes are expressed and evolve independently in isolation that allow sticklebacks to discriminate mates out of species. This research is one of the theoretical bases for the evolution of sexual selection. Specifically, organisms that do not mate out of their species get a fitness advantage. Once you are doing that kind of discrimination, it&rsquo;s not a big leap to do intraspecies mate selection (sexual selection).</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Within sticklebacks, they want to look at gene expression data.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p>What are the genes involved in female mate choice between conspecific and heterospecific males? and</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>How does this pattern of gene expression differ between closely related species?</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Within Avida:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p>Can reproductive isolation during ecological speciation evolve due to mate discrimination alone? and</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>What is the genetic basis and architecture of this choice? (e.g., perhaps choice is genetically correlated to the particular display of their population)</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m intererested in the Avida aspect.</p>

<h4>Methods:</h4>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>One population of organisms with sexual selection evolve together. (including mate choice, etc.)</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p>The sexual selection/mate choice is given by a set of numbers. Males can express the set of numbers. Some are condition dependent, some are flagged for increase, and some are random. The females choose on the basis of one or more of the expressed values.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A barrier is raised. What happens?</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p>How do the males adapt their displays? Which set of numbers do the females choose.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Ok, back to reading the sexual selection papers</strong></h3>
