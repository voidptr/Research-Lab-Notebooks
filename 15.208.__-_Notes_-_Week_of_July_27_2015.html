<h3>Lab Meeting 4:28PM</h3>

<p>Talked about the nestedness idea, that the nestedness pattern is generated by the complexity of rules that govern the mapping.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Complexity theory and information theory</li>
	<li>Rules in the mapping result in 1-many relationship, vs random relationships.</li>
	<li>Talk to Chris Adami</li>
	<li>Essentially, if it&#39;s easy to do, lots of people do it. If it&#39;s harder to do, fewer do it. The more information in the environment (mapping function), the harder the skew.</li>
	<li>Pattern appears in fields:
	<ul>
		<li>RNA folding</li>
		<li>Host-parasite interaction</li>
		<li>ecological interactions</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>My contentions:
	<ul>
		<li>The ranking skew is the same as the nestedness pattern
		<ul>
			<li>How do I rank this?
			<ul>
				<li>There are more parasites that infect already infected hosts? (is this circular?)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The skew is governed by the complexity of the rules of the mapping.
		<ul>
			<li>As measured by the bits of information in the rules.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

</ul>
