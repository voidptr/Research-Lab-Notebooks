<p>Yeah, so last week didn&rsquo;t really get very far. I was trying to figure out what minimal thing I needed to do, and what experiments I should be running.</p>

<p>So, to do one of the experiments I discussed last Wed (comparing the curvature of diversity measures), I need to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>implement whole-population genotypic entropy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>phenotype subdivided genotype diversity</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>phenotype diversity</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lab Meeting (3:45p)</h4>

<p>Discussed my goals for looking at diversity, which is to be able to distinguish between the environments that Translocation vs HGT would be acting in. So, first, I&rsquo;m trying to establish controls, comparing Translocation vs HGT, where the comparison variable is diversity. <strong>Then, do runs that increase diversity, and see how HGT does (just purely in terms of fitness) vs Translocation, but expect that in low diversity, HGT doesn&rsquo;t do any better than Translocation.</strong></p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s the initial experiment, showing that HGT is better than just Translocation. THEN:</p>

<p><strong>Do experiments to show that HGT results in higher fitnesses in changing environments vs static environments.</strong></p>

<p>Separately, Luis suggested a diversity metric that controls for all the things. He&rsquo;ll send me the link. Also, there&rsquo;s this Wikipedia page that might have some of what I&rsquo;m looking for: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index</a></p>

<h4>STATUS (9:04p)</h4>

<p>Completely worthless week, because stuck trying to get my stuff to debug without using Xcode for my development, because fuck that. I&rsquo;m going to try using vim. But, because I&rsquo;m stuck, I didn&rsquo;t really do anything. :(</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to try just using Xcode for the debugger. I found some instructions that I&rdquo;m going to try: <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=807021">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=807021</a></p>

<p>Sweet! It worked! I&rsquo;ve got a working project in Xcode that all it has in it is the executable. I had to go and create a new scheme, and then select the executable in Run section of the scheme dialog.</p>
