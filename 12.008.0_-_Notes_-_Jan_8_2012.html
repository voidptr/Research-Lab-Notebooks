<p>PREMISES/QUESTIONS</p>

<p>As shown by the last analysis:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Modularity DOES NOT change over time, between cycles.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, is this because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The mutation rate is too high?</li>
	<li>Or, is the entire measurement paradigm flawed?</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:right"><em>We don&rsquo;t allow slip mutations. Is this a problem?</em></p>

<p style="text-align:right"><em>Measuring modularity is a problem because there is a logical disconnect?</em></p>

<p style="text-align:right"><em>The hypothesis should be discarded or reformulated. Reformulate from first principles?</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DISCUSSION:</p>

<p>Because we are talking about whole populations upon which evolution is occurring, we must talk about AVERAGE MODULARITY. So, should we STOP TALKING ABOUT THE DOMINANT? Looking at the entire population may reduce the effect size, because we are including organisms that are inviable, or non-abundant. BUT, it would also remove noise (? right word?) from looking at single genotypes and extrapolating from them. So, we should do this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CONCLUSION 1:</p>

<p><u>Calculate modularity of EVERY GENOTYPE (weight by proportion of population), and average it. This is your modularity at any given point.</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DISCUSSION</p>

<p>How do we measure modularity over time, if measuring modularity requires the two tasks to exist in the first place? Is the &ldquo;punish&rdquo; experimental technique fundamentally flawed? Focusing on no-reward, which puts task preservation under stress, should we start with two tasks, non-colocated, and then see if, overall, we end up with the tasks being co-located? This should get at the fundamental question. Why haven&rsquo;t we done this already?</p>

<p>CONCLUSION 2:</p>

<p><u>Prepare experiment as above.</u></p>
