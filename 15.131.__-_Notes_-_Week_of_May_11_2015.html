<p><strong>Abstract for Sexual Selection and Speciation Paper</strong></p>

<p>Sexual selection is thought to play a major role in speciation by allowing sexual traits to diverge and produce incompatible mating types. In this study, we examine&nbsp;the influence of geographic isolation on the&nbsp;divergence of sexual and non-sexual traits and their impact on hybridization rates and hybrid viability.&nbsp;We evolved separated populations of sexually selective digital organism over 100,000 generations, and then performed both introductive (sexually selective)&nbsp;and forced&nbsp;(randomized) matring trials to evaluate the impact of genetic divergence on sexual attractiveness between populations, as well as viability of hybrid offspring. We found that the populations diverged rapidly in their sexual traits, regardless of variations in environment, such that they were significantly less likely to choose to mate between populations. However, offspring from forced matings were not significantly less viable than non-hybrid offspring. This indicates that sexual selection pressures enforce species boundaries long before natural selection does.</p>

<p>This is a hello :)</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in learning how this feels so I&#39;m doing a typing test. ;)</p>
