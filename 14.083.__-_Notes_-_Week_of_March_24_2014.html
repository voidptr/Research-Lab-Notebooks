<h3>Status (12:47p)</h3>

<p>Ooookay. So, I got exactly nothing done. Fuck. I have a window open with some files in it, but I&rsquo;m not sure what I was actually planning on doing. I&hellip; think I was trying to figure out how to add a new instruction. I&rsquo;m just going to copy and paste my previous log entry (todo portion) into here, and see if that gets me going. Depression is a bitch.</p>

<pre>
<code>TODO:
- dissertation chapter outline
- comps outline (by Tuesday!) (1/2 time!)
- science
    - Primary Goal:
        - Implement instruction to do HGT!!!
        - (10% time) - diversity measure (see Notes 14.055 - Feb 26)
        - (10% time) - genomic diffusion measure (see Notes 14.069 - Mar 12)
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s work on a comps outline. Per my previous lab notebooks, my dissertation chapters are supposed to be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intro</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Evolution of Modularity in Changing Environments</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Lateral Gene Transfer, Modularity, and Evolvability</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Evolvability and Sexual Selection</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>From HGT to Sexual Reproduction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, what are my comps supposed to look like? Probably pretty similar.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Intro</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Evolution of Modularity in Changing Environments</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Intro/Research Justification</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Lit review</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Methods</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Results</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Proposal - Lateral Gene Transfer, Modularity and Evolvability</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Intro/Research Justification</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Lit review</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Methods</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Proposal - Evolvability and Sexual Selection</p>

	<ul>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Proposal - From HGT to Sexual Reproduction</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Intro/Research Justification</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Lit review</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Methods</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>I sent Charles an email with my top level comps outline, just to make sure we&rsquo;re on the same page.</p>

<h3>Devolab Meeting (3:00p)</h3>

<p>Sent an email to Heather asking her for the mutagenic instruction code (or rather, a pointer thereto). Hopefully this will get me started on the HGT instructions.</p>
