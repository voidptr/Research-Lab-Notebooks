<h2>Previously...&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Spent a ton of stupid time exploring the latest in Jupyter (iPython notebooks) and BeakerNotebooks. Most of that time, I can consider wasted.</p>

<p>Ok, but seriously, there&#39;s some kind of horrible problem here, and I don&#39;t understand it, and it freaks me out. :( It&#39;s something to do with how lists are formed, and what happens with a copy and paste, and it breaks the back-end. :(</p>

<p>But, seriously, this is some bullshit, and I can&#39;t figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either way, I ripped out the iPython Notebook integration. Now I&#39;m just going to be allowing the user to start it, and there&#39;s a link in the home-page.</p>

<p>Todos:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Git integration and version control of the autosaved file
	<ul>
		<li>Rolling version compression, to avoid balooning.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Possibly update the back-end version of CKEditor, if there&#39;s some feature I want, or some incompatibility.
	<ul>
		<li>Might also consider migrating to ProseMirror when it becomes available, since it seems to have a more congenial license.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Create desktop shortcuts to launch the URL of this week&#39;s&nbsp;notebook, as I have done in the past.</li>
	<li>Consider setting up some kind of automated archive so the files don&#39;t all show up in stupid-order.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Consider sorting the files by date
	<ul>
		<li>Maybe add some sortable arrows, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Re-visit saving the files as MD, depending on where flask_flatpages is now</li>
	<li>Consider moving away from flask_flatpages, since it seems to ... suck? Be broken in some way that I don&#39;t understand?</li>
</ul>

<p>Right, so, before bed, outlining what I&#39;m doing tomorrow. I am going to shoot for a solid day of work. Start by opening up the development environment, reading over my logs, and picking up where I left off on my HGT work. I mean, it looks like most everything is there to do the work. I&#39;ll diagram it on paper, if I have to.</p>

<p>Umm, yeah, ok I&#39;ve already wasted a couple hours this morning dicking around on the internet. Time to spend five minutes doing a code-slog.</p>

<p>These log entries are the primary pointers to the work I accomplished on the HGT stuff before I got derailed by the Diversity work. But recrimination is for losers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve fixed the error where my old stuff wasn&#39;t loading because there seems to be an annoying bug with flask_flatpages where if there&#39;s no meta-data, it just ... fucks up. Anyway, this means that I can probably just rip out the code that adds that stupid blank line at the beginning, which was just a workaround for this. Ok, that&#39;s now done. Back to work</p>

<p>How to make it work, per my notes:</p>

<p>Jan 20:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so made a copy of avida.cfg to avida_HGT_on.cfg. Only thing I changed was to enable HGT. Everything else was left as in defaults:</p>

<pre>
<code>682 ### HGT_GROUP ### 
683 # Horizontal gene transfer settings 
684 ENABLE_HGT 1                    # Whether HGT is enabled; 0=false (default), </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Jan 27:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beside that, the config files you need to set up for HGT are as follows:</p>

<p>Add a line to environment.cfg</p>

<pre>
<code>RESOURCE  GenomeFragments:hgt=1
</code></pre>

<p>Change the following lines in avida.cfg. Specifically, you have to enable both HGT_COMPETENCE_P and HGT_INSERTION_MUT_P to ensure that insertions (rather than purely replacements) happen. If HGT_COMPETENCE_P is zero, then NOTHING HAPPENS. It is the governing probability.</p>

<pre>
<code>682 ### HGT_GROUP ###

	<ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>You don&rsquo;t need this declaration, so I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s there. Stupid. Futher, it seems to silently cover the virtual method \(cOrgInterface\).</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>\(cPopulationInterface.cc\) - implementation of&nbsp;<code>GetLGTFragment()</code>&nbsp;(line 158)</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><em>This method will need to be changed to be able to draw down resources.</em></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>kinda baffled why there are method bodies in a class with the word Interface in its name. Is it because it&rsquo;s not a software interface, as much as the place where the population interfaces with the environment? weird. don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>\(cTestCPUInterface.h\) - same song and dance. derives from \(cOrgInterface.h\).</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>So, it looks incredibly simple. Most of the work and code is done in&nbsp;<code>cHardwareBase</code>. To add the appropriate resource-drawing code, I&rsquo;ll need to have a look at what other resource users are doing. In the HGT code, the resource drawing code is in&nbsp;<code>cPopulationInterface.cc</code>. It looks like the LGT code is always available</p>

<p>So, at minimum, merging will require:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>connecting to the resource code (<code>cPopulation.cc, cPopulationCell.cc, cEnvironment.cc, cResource.h</code>), if a fragment resource is requested via config options (such as&nbsp;<code>LGT_SOURCE_REGION</code>&nbsp;option).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>adding appropriate stats (<code>cStats.h</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>.cc</code>)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Optionally, to bring the full vestment of previous features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>engaging the ACTIONS (<code>PopulationActions.cc</code>)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>implement the HGTDonation concept. This may already be implemented in some LGT code, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;Right, so having said all that, I had begun an initial implementation, and combined some things, and succeeded in doing some runs. Now, I need to replicate some of those runs.</p>

<h3>Log 1:19p</h3>

<p>Spent some time re-upping my development environment, because QT Creator sucks more than I remember. I installed a bunch</p>

<ul>
	<li>Eclipse CPP</li>
	<li>CLion</li>
	<li>CodeBlocks</li>
	<li>CodeLite</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently trhing CLion. Had to tikner abit with the font size to get hidpi to work. Had to copy the theme before it let me edit the font, and select a checkbox that it warned me against before it would work. Also, the build window and its little dialog windows are still a tiny print, but the menus and most of the widgets and icons finally resized. Trying to build now.</p>

<h3>Log 1:08p</h3>

<p>Yeah, so CLion looks pretty nice, and like it&#39;ll do what I want. a couple of glitchy things, but nothin serious. And it lets me define the working directory, which is muuuuch nicer than the alternative.</p>

<p>Anyway, last night, spent some time thinking about the design for the instruction, etc. I want to use other Dave&#39;s (not Bryson) reservoir code, with an instruction that uses it. Bryson&#39;s LGT code is just kinda stupid and superfluous so I&#39;m just going to ignore it.</p>

<p>It turns out I&#39;ve already got some code for my HGT action, which will be an instruction.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also dug around and found that I missed a few references. So I am documenting them here.</p>

<p>Finished adding the action, but there are some significant todos because some of my shit is getting garbage collected and I&#39;m not sure how to make it stop. :( Like, I shove ints into an array, and they .... disappear randomly! Woo! So, I am just having it do it again if that happens, grabbing a new random number, but I&#39;m afraid this will break cross-platform replicability with the random number generator, since it might garbage collect at different points on different systems, causing a different set of random numbers to get generated. :( In any case, I&#39;m reasonably sure the reservoirs are getting filled with fragments.</p>

<p>Next step is to flesh out the HGT Uptake instruction code.</p>
