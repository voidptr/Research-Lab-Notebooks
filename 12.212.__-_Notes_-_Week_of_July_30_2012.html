<p>STATUS:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After a leisurely vacation, getting back into the swing.</li>
	<li>Previously, made evolight, an evolutionary color-gradient smoother. At <a href="https://github.com/voidptr/evolight">https://github.com/voidptr/evolight</a></li>
	<li>Am going to start a new set of experiments, but first, have to review where I left off.</li>
</ul>

<p>STATUS:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ok, per my last major status to Charles, I want to explore how initial architecture affects evolution time. So, first step is to evolve a bunch of organisms with different architectures.
	<ul>
		<li>Organisms:
		<ul>
			<li>Control &ndash; blank self-replicator</li>
			<li>Tightly evolved self-replicator (no task rewards)</li>
			<li>Advanced two-task &ndash; evolved to reward only when BOTH tasks are done.</li>
			<li>Advanced two-task with enforced no others &ndash; evolve stairstep of punishment of other tasks</li>
			<li>Low Epistasis &ndash; Evolved to do single tasks, then stitched together.</li>
			<li>Cyclic two-task punished &ndash; lots of vestigial sites</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Evaluate
		<ul>
			<li>Number of vestigial sites
			<ul>
				<li>lethals &ndash; ko kills organism</li>
				<li>tasks</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Number of active sites
			<ul>
				<li>lethals &ndash; ko kills organism</li>
				<li>tasks</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Modularity</li>
			<li>Counts of jumps</li>
			<li>Character of vestigial (what instructions are represented)</li>
			<li>Number of mutations to achieve new task acquisition</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
