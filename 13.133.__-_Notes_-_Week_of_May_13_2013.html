<p>RANDOM THOUGHTS:</p>

<ul>
	<li>evolving rules for cellular automata. Read Wolfram&rsquo;s A New Kind Of Science</li>
	<li>make up a professional reading list. The Mind&rsquo;s I, A New Kind of Science, books that will make me a better read person, outside of science fiction.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PREFACE:</p>

<p>For whatever reason, work has been incredibly hard for me to get motivated about. I really don&rsquo;t want to do it. This is probably related to the rest of it, which is that I don&rsquo;t want to do *anything*. So, for the past month (past summer?), I&rsquo;ve gotten virtually nothing done. My research has stalled, and I feel like crap about it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RESEARCH-WISE:</p>

<p>Recently, I decided to procrastinate further by updating everything to Avida 3. This appears to have been a mistake. I have discovered that my runs no longer perform the way that they used to. Specifically, EQU is being lost very early in the evolutionary process. So, I need to figure this out. To that end, I will need to replicate runs that I had done before, with same configs and seeds and see if I get the same results. This is a critical first step to being able to continue with Avida 3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PLAN:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set up identical runs to 082, where I&rsquo;ve confirmed that EQU is not evolving away.</li>
</ul>
