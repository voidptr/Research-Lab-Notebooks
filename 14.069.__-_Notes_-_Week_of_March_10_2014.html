<h4>STATUS (6:38p)</h4>

<p>Had my meeting with Charles. My dissertation chapters:</p>

<p>Intro</p>

<p>Evolution of Modularity in Changing Environments</p>

<p>Lateral Gene Transfer, Modularity, and Evolvability</p>

<p>Evolvability and Sexual Selection</p>

<p>From HGT to Sexual Reproduction</p>

<h4>Rosie Redfield Talk (4:10p)</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Do bacteria have sex?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do bacteria have any processes that evolved to make new combinations ochromosomal genes?&quot;</p>

<pre>
<code>runaway traits (do some reading)
    is sex a runaway trait? Obligate sexual reproducers, and hgt mutators have higher fitness than non-obligate.
    but organisms evolve away from using these features if given a chance.
    experiment: mixed population of obligate/non-obligate hgters. Then, see which wins out in final counts.
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;recA - recombination enzyme (recA-Z jillion flavors)&quot;</p>

<p>recA - is a genome repair enzyme</p>

<p>others recombination enzyes - fixes for DNA replication problems</p>

<p>DNA is food. Recombination happens accidentally???</p>

<pre>
<code>Make sure to cite the papers about metabolism of external DNA (competence).
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code>How much of regulation is inhibition (brakes?)
</code></pre>

<p>Ah! Redfield&rsquo;s hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>food</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>to get nucleotides</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>DNA replication has stalled and may collapse, due to a lack of nucleotides (thus the low Purine signal, purine presence acting as a brake)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>This was tested because there *are* recombination genes.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eukaryote sexual reproduction must have evolved to solve a problem specific and endemic to eukaryotes.</strong></p>

<p>\[ Sunita Sinha; Josh Mell - read research from Redfield Lab \]</p>

<p>To bring the strand in, the 3-prime-facing strand doesn&rsquo;t get degraded.</p>

<pre>
<code>Think about single-celled eukaryotes. Do eukaryotes uptake DNA like bacteria? Maybe they have sex because the nucleus blocks accidental uptake?
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code>Look at the regulatory question. How much of the uptake gets attached in an aligned fashion? How many nucleotides have to be aligned? Is this under selection?
</code></pre>

<p>Uptake motifs - sequence biases for what gets taken up.</p>

<pre>
<code>Is there a bias for which sequences get recombined successfully?
</code></pre>

<h4>Chatting w/ Mike after the talk</h4>

<p>\(Does HGT get up/down regulated when you have high/low diversity. Specifically, does it happen less when the sequences you will be taking up are going to vary wildly from your own genome.\)</p>

<h4>Log (9:55a)</h4>

<p>Really need to get my shit together.</p>

<p>Ok, setting the diversity measures aside for now. I want to be able to run some experiments before I get on the plane so that I have something to show on Tuesday.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>implement instructions to do HGT experiments</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>secondary goal: implement genomic diffusion measure (essentially mutational robustness among offspring).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>secondary goal: implement diversity measures</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, I have a bunch of experiments I want to do. I think I need to go back over my lab notebooks to get it done. What&rsquo;s frustrating about the notebooks is that I want to have a physical book that I can mark up with tabs and flags and things, but such a thing doesn&rsquo;t exist&hellip; Do I have to fucking write it? I&rsquo;ve looked at some of the nice wysiwyg html editors (ckeditor), which might serve, but I&rsquo;d need to have a backend for it.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>Log (11:30a)</h4>

<p>Right, so I just bunnytrailed for an hour looking at notebooks. There&rsquo;s one called GraphTerm, which has some notebook capability, but it&rsquo;s moderately limited. :/ I found it because it said it had ckeditor support, but I&rsquo;m not sure it actually does. Anyway, that&rsquo;s enough distraction on that topic. I need to possibly set up a timer every hour to remind me to think about what I&rsquo;m doing, really pop the stack, and make sure I&rsquo;m working on things that are productive. Staying on topic is hard. I&rsquo;m not distracted, like ADD, but I get derailed pretty easily. :(</p>
