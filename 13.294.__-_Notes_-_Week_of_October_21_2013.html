<p>Log:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Up at 11:30, due to a minor commotion with Mike discovering (by almost stepping in) some cat vomit. Cleaned it up.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cleaned up kitchen and made coffee. Chatted with Mike until 12:30ish.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Into office. Let Stewart in for a bit. Cleaned up space around monitors a bit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Checked email, read some extant reddit tabs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>ACCOMPLISHED: Made ATTiny85 talk to WS2811 pixel. Also, found neato 16mhz hack for ATTiny85, which is now installed in my boards.txt. Not needed for pixel, but still neat.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Purchased and installed NeoOffice as a Word and LibreOffice replacement, since LibreOffice has pretty bad performance and font rendering code. NeoOffice is $10, but is open source. Pretty happy with it so far.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Reinstalled Cambria and Calibri fonts. Yay.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Tinkered on Mouser and Digikey for a bit, ordered some ATTinys from Mouser (way cheaper here, for some reason).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Updating log (so meta) around 4:25. The afternoon has gone exclusively to the items listed above.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>4:30, went to make food. Returned with pasta, pesto, parmesan, and butter at 4:47.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>4:49 facebook.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>5:18 done facebooking</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>5:47 done reading RSS feeds</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>6:23 &ndash; checkpoint. Compiling avida. Been futzing with work since finishing RSS feeds.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>7:19 &ndash; checkpoint. Avida finished compiling a while ago, but I&#39;ve been reading boingboing. Back to work now.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>9:00ish &ndash; worked for a while, but got stuck on AvidaEd. The linker pukes when I try to compile the viewer library as a DLL instead of a static library. Got frustrated and watched a couple episodes of Downton Abbey with Kendall.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>10:30ish. Back to work, futzed a tiny bit, but just sent a status message to Rob, Charles, and Dave.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Futzed with my attiny light project. Got everything set up in a project box with the programmer and breadboard. Next is getting touch sensors working via i2c.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>12:06 &ndash; going to bed.</p>
	</li>

<h2>Tuesday 10/22/13</h2>

<p>Log:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Got up around 10:15. In the night, I resolved to lose some weight in order to control the snoring that seems to accompany any mass &gt; 150lb. The unpleasantness and axiety of not being able to sleep at night is a pretty strong visceral motivator. Resolving to do it in that context felt like losing weight was going to be totally easy and doable. Could the secret to all action be finding the right motivation? Also, Kendall brought me coffee! :D</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>futzing with putting together a formalized CypressCapsense library. Currently working on the example code.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Stopped working around 2:00. Futzed on facebook and reader until 2:20.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ofria Lab meeting at 3:00.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
