<p>Ok, I&#39;m going to try to write a methods section for the sexual selection work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>We used version XXX Avida to perform the experiments in sexual selection. Executables, source, and experimental settings may be found at http://github.... Avida is a digital life platform where digital organisms, sets of&nbsp;ordered computer instructions that&nbsp;execute on a virtual CPU, exist in a shared world with other digital organisms. These organisms mutate, reproduce,&nbsp;and&nbsp;compete for space and resources. Limited resources are available in the environment. Organism uptake these resources by performing logical tasks, and then receive a speed bonus depending on the complexity of the task performed. This speed bonus allows the organisms to execute their genomes more quickly, and thus reproduce more quickly, and thus outcompete their peers</li>
	<li>Default settings were used throughout, except where noted otherwise. Sexual reproduction between two sexes&nbsp;is enabled, as well as female mate choice. Sexes are determined by execution of&nbsp;the ZZZ instructions,&nbsp;ZZZ1 being male, ZZZ2 being female. The ZZZ2 sex instruction also incurrs an execution time penalty of NNN updates, thus delaying the execution of females by NNN updates, as compared to their male counterparts.&nbsp;The first sex instruction executed determines the sex of the organism for their lifetime.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Female mate choice is dictated by expression of the XXX instruction, which sets a target trait value. Males express a particular trait value by using the YYY instruction.&nbsp;Upon executing the DIV_SEX instruction, the organisms divide, and inject their gametes&nbsp;into the&nbsp;mating chamber. The gametes are stored&nbsp;in order of arrival&nbsp;where they wait for an organism of the opposite sex to arrive. Because the females will generally be slower in executing, there will generally be more males in the birth chamber, allowing the females to have a set of males to choose from.&nbsp;When a female gamete arrives in the birth chamber, she can&nbsp;choose a mate&nbsp;based on the similarity of the male&#39;s expressed trait value. The more similar the trait, the more likely the female is to choose that male. If several matching trait values are found, the female chooses between them randomly. The gamete genomes&nbsp;are recombined, and the offspring is then injected into the world.</li>
	<li>We performed fifty trials, with three stages. In the first stage, a population of 3600 individuals was allowed to evolve for 100,000 updates, and rewarded for performing Logic 9 operations. Then the population is split into two of 1800 individuals which are then allowed to evolve independently for another 100,000 updates. Finally, the two populations are re-joined, and allowed to mate freely. We measured the rate of hybridization between the two populations, as well as the viability and fitness of&nbsp;hybrids.</li>
</ul>
