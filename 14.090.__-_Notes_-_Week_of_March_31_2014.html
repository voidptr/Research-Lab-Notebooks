<h4>Talk by &hellip; Dude at MIT</h4>

<p>Discussion of HGT, Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) (phase and plasmid-like) - ICE<em>Bs1</em></p>

<p>The elements are sections of DNA that replicate independently, and (transfer machinery) mediate their transfer to new cells. They use quorum sensing to not initiate transfer and infection if the element has already infected the other cell. It&rsquo;s a self-replicating element. It&rsquo;s a parasite. It&rsquo;s around 20kb. Many smaller elements are 15-20kb.</p>

<p>RecA -&gt; activates when there is DNA damage. So&hellip; is it activating when damage reveals a weakness?</p>

<p>Fuck, these things have no respect! ZOMG. LIFE HAS NO RESPECT. IT JUST TAKES ADVANTAGE WHEN IT CAN.</p>

<p>Is HGT (conjugation) a kind of parasitism? Did sex originate as parasitism, creating the mechanisms that could then be coopted by the host cell, to forcibly inject its content into another cell? Is this what sexual reproduction started as? Things mating AT you may be bad for your fitness, but it&rsquo;s good for the fitness of the donor. So, sexual antagonism may be the rule, rather than the exception.</p>

<p>Read about plasmids, etc. Plasmids replicate themselves. So, are plasmids and ICEs runaway, stripped down, gonads (self-replicating machinery code)?</p>

<p>I want to look at doing instructions for this in Avida. So, the instruction would be infection of sections of code, including the instruction. Look for the conjugation thing. Conjugation is apparently super duper common.</p>
