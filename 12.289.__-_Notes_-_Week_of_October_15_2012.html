<p>LAB MEETING NOTES:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes to self:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Look for 13&rdquo; retina rumors.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talk about:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bitch about DIV_MUT vs DIVIDE_MUT</li>
	<li>Fixed length, vs sterilize unstable, vs both (097-099) &ndash; no obvious differences in task execution or lineage distribution.</li>
	<li>Penalize vs Kill (very different). Every 50 updates is very effective at killing off the lineages. (linvstask)</li>
	<li>How to interpret bottlenecking graphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thoughts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kill &ndash; theory says you should kill between every 1-5 generations (10-50 updates).</li>
	<li>Charles suggests, to address the accepted mutation rate question, just USE KILL FOR FUCKS SAKE, to create your control (instead of trying to relate the bottlenecking to the penalize), and then compare against the exact kill bottleneck profile to perform a random bottleneck at that level, then compare the accepted mutation rates.</li>
</ul>
