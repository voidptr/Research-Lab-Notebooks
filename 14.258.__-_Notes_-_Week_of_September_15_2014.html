<p>Ok, I really didn&#39;t do anything last week, but I thought about it a bit. Charles suggested the resource punishment for switching tasks, exactly the way I&#39;d tried it before, but which had failed. But, he suggested using mult instead of add. :/ Trying it.</p>

<p>I have actually generated a ton of flame graphs. I&#39;ll add them to the previous weeks.</p>

<p>Ok, had a short meeting with Charles. Explained that the punishment for switching tasks seems to be working, and that we&#39;re getting what seem to be stable branches in the flame graph. I think the next step is to figure out what is actually going on, and who is actually using the thingies. I can create an output file that reads the population dumps into analyze mode and prints out what tasks each thingy is doing... maybe. I&#39;ll have to see if that&#39;s something analyze mode can do. :/</p>

<p>Disallow zero after some time in the run?</p>

<h3>Lab Meeting 3:16p</h3>

<p>Did a series of runs with the working switching punishment (via environment file)</p>

<p>Right, so there are obviously stable branches evolving, but it&#39;s still not using them in a useful fashion... maybe. I need to figure out how</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cliff has been doing:
	<ul>
		<li>link tasks to the display.</li>
		<li>female can be choosy independently.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Other options or possibilities
	<ul>
		<li>add several little display traits A,B,C,D,E,F,G and have them use those.
		<ul>
			<li>remove display trait C, or rename it. :/</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>there is a bug? Because my hard_match runs were IDENTICAL (fuck!) to my non-hard-match.</li>
		<li>do bit string environments.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Email Art about how he keeps track of the complete parental lineage. Does he dump it to disk?</li>
</ul>
